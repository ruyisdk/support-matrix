- Download Link: [Releases · ryan4yin/nixos-licheepi4a](https://github.com/ryan4yin/nixos-licheepi4a/releases)
  - u-boot: [Releases · ryan4yin/nixos-licheepi4a](https://github.com/ryan4yin/nixos-licheepi4a/releases)
- Fastboot Links:
  - [Baidu Pan Link](https://pan.baidu.com/e/1xH56ZlewB6UOMlke5BrKWQ)
  - [MegaNZ Link](https://mega.nz/folder/phoQlBTZ#cZeQ3qZ__pDvP94PT3_bGA)

### Hardware Information

- Lichee Pi 4A (16GB RAM + 128GB eMMC)
- Power Adapter
- A microSD card
- A USB to UART Debugger

## Installation Steps

### Flashing Image

Use `zstd` to decompress the image.
Use `dd` to flash the image to the microSD card.

```bash
zstd -d /path/to/nixos-licheepi4a-sd-image-23.05.20230806.240472b-riscv64-linux.img.zst
sudo dd if=/path/to/nixos-licheepi4a-sd-image-23.05.20230806.240472b-riscv64-linux.img.zst of=/dev/your_device bs=1M status=progress
```

### Flashing Bootloader

Enter fastboot mode.

- Press BOOT while powering on.
- (Refer to the official tutorial) Use the fastboot command to flash u-boot.

```bash
sudo ./fastboot flash ram ./path/to/your/u-boot-with-spl.bin
sudo ./fastboot reboot
sudo ./fastboot flash uboot ./path/to/your/u-boot-with-spl.bin
```

### Logging into the System

Logging into the system via the serial port.

default username：`lp4a` default password: `lp4a` 

## Expected Results
