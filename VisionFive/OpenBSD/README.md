## Installation Steps

### Extracting dtb File

Decompress the Fedora image, mount the boot partition, and copy the `jh7100-starfive-visionfive-v1.dtb` file from the dtb folder.

### Flashing Installation Image

Use `gzip` to decompress the image.
Use `dd` to flash the image to the microSD card.

```bash
wget https://cdn.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/snapshots/riscv64/install75.img
sudo dd if=install75.img of=/dev/your-device bs=1M status=progress
```

Place the dtb file into the EFI root directory:

```bash
mkdir -p mnt
sudo mount /dev/your-device-p1 mnt
cp jh7100-starfive-visionfive-v1.dtb mnt/
sudo umount mnt
```

### Booting the System

Manually interrupt the u-boot process and input the boot command:
```bash
load mmc 0:1 0x88000000 jh7100-starfive-visionfive-v1.dtb
load mmc 0:1 0x84000000 efi/boot/bootriscv64.efi
bootefi 0x84000000 0x88000000
```

Follow the installation flow and place the dtb file into the EFI root directory again (if it was overwritten).

### Persistent Uboot

```bash
env default -a -f
setenv bootcmd "load mmc 0:1 0x88000000 jh7100-starfive-visionfive-v1.dtb; load mmc 0:1 0x84000000 efi/boot/bootriscv64.efi; bootefi 0x84000000 0x88000000"
saveenv
```

### Logging into the System

User and password are set during installation.

## Expected Results

The system should boot normally and allow login via the onboard serial port.

## Actual Results
