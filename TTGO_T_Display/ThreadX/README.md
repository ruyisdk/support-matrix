- Download Links:
    - SDK: https://github.com/Nuclei-Software/nuclei-sdk
    - Toolchain: https://www.nucleisys.com/download.php
        - https://download.nucleisys.com/upload/files/toolchain/gcc/nuclei_riscv_newlibc_prebuilt_linux64_nuclei-2024.tar.bz2

        - https://download.nucleisys.com/upload/files/toolchain/openocd/nuclei-openocd-2024.02.28-linux-x64.tgz

### Hardware Information

- TTGO T-Display-GD32
- A USB to UART Debugger
- **JTAG Debugger**
- A Type-C Cable

## Installation Steps

### Environment Setup

Download and extract the toolchain and OpenOCD, then set up the toolchain directory:
```bash
wget https://download.nucleisys.com/upload/files/toolchain/gcc/nuclei_riscv_newlibc_prebuilt_linux64_nuclei-2024.tar.bz2
tar -xjvf nuclei_riscv_newlibc_prebuilt_linux64_nuclei-2024.tar.bz2
wget https://download.nucleisys.com/upload/files/toolchain/openocd/nuclei-openocd-2024.02.28-linux-x64.tgz
tar -xzvf nuclei-openocd-2024.02.28-linux-x64.tgz
export NUCLEI_TOOL_ROOT=$(pwd)
```

Download the SDK:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Nuclei-Software/nuclei-sdk.git
cd nuclei-sdk
echo "NUCLEI_TOOL_ROOT=$(echo $NUCLEI_TOOL_ROOT)" > setup_config.sh
source setup.sh
```

### Compiling the Code

Compile ThreadX:
```bash
cd application/threadx/demo
make SOC=gd32vf103 BOARD=gd32vf103c_t_display clean
make SOC=gd32vf103 BOARD=gd32vf103c_t_display all
```

### Flashing the Image

Connect to the development board via your JTAG debugger. Note that the board should be powered on while flashing.

Make sure your debugger and OpenOCD binary is supported by the build system.
For the former, consider editing relevant settings in `../../../SoC/gd32vf103/Board/gd32vf103c_t_display/openocd_gd32vf103.cfg` to match your JTAG debugger.
e.g. with Sipeed SLogic Combo 8 debugger at DAP-Link mode:
```diff
diff --git a/SoC/gd32vf103/Board/gd32vf103c_t_display/openocd_gd32vf103.cfg b/SoC/gd32vf103/Board/gd32vf103c_t_display/openocd_gd32vf103.cfg

 transport select jtag
 
 set _CHIPNAME riscv
```

Also adding an udev rule if necessary (refer to https://github.com/arduino/OpenOCD/blob/master/contrib/60-openocd.rules)
For the latter, make sure your OpenOCD version is up to date with support for your debugger; a known usable version is at https://github.com/xpack-dev-tools/openocd-xpack/releases/tag/v0.12.0-4

When all set, flash the binary with:
```bash
make SOC=gd32vf103 BOARD=gd32vf103c_t_display upload
```

> Still unable to connect to the board? Try re-flashing its firmware via its DFU bootloader.
> 
> Download the firmware from here: https://github.com/Xinyuan-LilyGO/LilyGO-T-DisplayGD32/raw/refs/heads/master/firmware/GD32V_CBT6_20200116.bin
> 
> Press the BOOT button while plugging in the board to enter DFU mode. `lsusb` should show something like:
> 
> ```shell
> Bus 001 Device 047: ID 28e9:0189 GDMicroelectronics GD32 DFU Bootloader (Longan Nano)
> # "Longan Nano" is intended behavior
> ```

> Flash the firmware with `gd32-dfu-utils` (https://github.com/riscv-mcu/gd32-dfu-utils):
> 
> ```shell
> sudo gd32-dfu-util -D GD32V_CBT6_20200116.bin
> ```

### System Startup

Connect to the development board via the serial port.

## Expected Results

The system should boot up normally, and information should be viewable via the onboard serial port.

## Actual Results

The system booted up normally, and information are viewable via the onboard serial port.
