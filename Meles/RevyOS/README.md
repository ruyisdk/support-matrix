## Installation Steps

### Flashing Image using `fastboot` onto the Development Board

Download the system image and U-Boot SPL from [GitHub release](https://github.com/milkv-meles/meles-images/releases).

U-Boot with SPL version selection:
- 4GB Version -> u-boot-with-spl-**single**rank.bin
- 8GB Version -> u-boot-with-spl-**dual**rank.bin

Press and hold the download button near the GPIO interface on the development board and connect the board to the computer.

Check connection status:

```shell
$ lsusb | grep T-HEAD
Bus 001 Device 045: ID 2345:7654 T-HEAD USB download gadget
```

Next, use `fastboot` to flash the image.

If `fastboot` doesn't recognize the device or you encounter flashing issues, check the device connection and try running `fastboot` as a privileged user (`sudo`).

```shell
fastboot flash ram u-boot-with-spl-dualrank.bin
fastboot reboot
fastboot flash uboot u-boot-with-spl-dualrank.bin
fastboot flash boot boot.ext4
tar xvf root-meles-20231210_134926.ext4.tar.gz
fastboot flash root root-meles-20231210_134926.ext4
