# openEuler Lichee Cluster 4A Test Report

## Test Environment

### System Information

- System Version: openEuler 23.09 RISC-V preview
- Download Link: [Here](https://mirror.iscas.ac.cn/openeuler-sig-riscv/openEuler-RISC-V/preview/openEuler-23.09-V1-riscv64/lpi4a/)
- Reference Installation Documentation: [Here](https://revyos.github.io/)

### Hardware Information

- Lichee Cluster 4A 8G / 16G
- DC 12V Power Supply
- USB-A to A
    - or LPi4A baseboard
- Network and Ethernet Cable (ensure connection to BMC instead of switch)

## Installation Steps

*Using the example of flashing to the first board in the cluster*

### Connect the Corresponding SOM

Use an A to A cable to connect the SOM.

### Use the `ruyi` CLI to Flash the Image to the Onboard eMMC

Install the [`ruyi`](https://github.com/ruyisdk/ruyi) package manager, run `ruyi device provision`, and follow the prompts.

Choose the image accordingly for LPi4A.

### Logging into the System

Logging into the system via SOL (Serial Over LAN).

BMC default username: `root`

BMC default password: `0penBmc` **Note: it's `0` not `O`**

Connect using `ssh -p 2301 root@lichee-rv.local`

Default username: `openeuler` or `root`
Default password: `openEuler12#$`

### Common Issues

If USB is not working, it may be due to needing to patch the Linux device tree. [Download the patch here](https://dl.sipeed.com/fileList/LICHEE/LicheeCluster4A/04_Firmware/lpi4a/src/linux/0001-arch-riscv-boot-dts-lpi4a-disable-i2c-io-expander-fo.patch)

If you prefer not to compile the dtb manually, you can extract the dtb (light-lpi4a.dtb) from the [precompiled image](https://dl.sipeed.com/shareURL/LICHEE/LicheeCluster4A/04_Firmware/lpi4a/bin) and replace the corresponding file in the boot directory.

## Expected Results

The system boots up successfully and allows login via SOL (Serial Over LAN).

## Actual Results

The system boots up successfully and allows login via SOL (Serial Over LAN).
