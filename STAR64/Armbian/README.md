# Armbian Star64 Test Report

> [!WARNING]
> Armbian for Star64's GitHub release versions were already removed; while in out tests, the last available archived version did not boot either.
> You'll be greeted with the same `bootarg overflow 265+0+0+1 > 256` error as shown below, if using U-Boot from Ubuntu/Debian, or straight from mainline U-Boot.
> It seems Armbian's support for Star64 is EOL. It is recommended to use other distros instead.

## Test Environment

### Operating System Information

- Download Link (expired/removed): https://github.com/armbian/community/releases/download/25.2.0-trunk.124/Armbian_community_25.2.0-trunk.124_Star64_noble_edge_5.15.0_xfce_desktop.img.xz
    - Last available archived version: https://k-space.ee.armbian.com/archive/star64/archive/
- Reference Installation Document: https://www.hackster.io/lupyuen/rtos-on-a-risc-v-sbc-star64-jh7110-apache-nuttx-2a7429

### Hardware Information

- Development Board: Star64
- USB A to C / USB C to C Cable
- SD Card

## Installation Steps

### Flashing Image

After downloading, unzip and flash the image (using the xfce version as an example):
```bash
unxz -k Armbian_community_25.2.0-trunk.124_Star64_noble_edge_5.15.0_xfce_desktop.img.xz
sudo dd if=Armbian_community_25.2.0-trunk.124_Star64_noble_edge_5.15.0_xfce_desktop.img of=/dev/your/sdcard bs=1M status=progress
```

### Logging into the System

Connect to the development board via the serial port.

Upon startup, the system will prompt the user to manually configure the username, password, timezone, language, etc.

The Xfce version requires configuration completion before entering the desktop environment.

Configuration can be done via the serial port. If a keyboard and monitor are connected, it can also be done via the keyboard.

## Expected Results

The system boots up normally, and information can be viewed through the onboard serial port.

## Actual Results

Image fails to boot with `Boot failed (err=-14)`.
