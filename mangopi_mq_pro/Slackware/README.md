zstd -d slarm64-current-riscv64-xfce-mangopi_mq_pro-6.1.53-build-20230919.img.zst
sudo dd if=slarm64-current-riscv64-xfce-mangopi_mq_pro-6.1.53-build-20230919.img of=/dev/your_device bs=1M status=progress
```

### Logging into the System

Plug in the power via the USB-C "OTG" port (instead of "HOST") to avoid issues with faulty power supply (see https://forums.100ask.net/t/topic/876/6).
