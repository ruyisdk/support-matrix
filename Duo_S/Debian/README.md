# Debian Milk-V Duo S Test Report

## Test Environment

### Operating System Information

- Download Link: https://github.com/Fishwaldo/sophgo-sg200x-debian/releases/tag/v1.4.0
- Reference Installation Document: https://github.com/Fishwaldo/sophgo-sg200x-debian

### Hardware Information

- Milk-V Duo S (512M, SG2000)
- A USB power adapter
- A USB-A to C or USB C to C cable for powering the development board
- A microSD card
- A USB card reader
- A USB to UART Debugger   
    - Only CP210x series is recommeneded (e.g. CP2102/CP2104). Be aware you'll only get garbled text output on WCH CH340/341 series; you can still use other USB-UART chips like FT232 and CH343 series, although you might still get garbled output but only before U-Boot loads, this is expected. If UART isn't working at all please consider try another USB-UART adaptor.
- Three DuPont wires

## Installation Steps

### Using `dd` to Flash the Image to the microSD Card

```shell
lz4 -dk duos_sd.img.lz4
sudo dd if=duos_sd.img of=/dev/sdX bs=1M status=progress
```

### Logging into the System

## Expected Results
