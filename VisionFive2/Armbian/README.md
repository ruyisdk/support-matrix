# Armbian VisionFive 2 Test Report

## Test Environment

### Operating System Information

- System Version: Armbian Noble Minimal & Armbian Jammy Xfce
- Download Link: https://www.armbian.com/visionfive2/
- Reference Installation Documentation: https://www.armbian.com/visionfive2/

### Hardware Information

- StarFive VisionFive 2
- A USB Power Adapter
- A USB-A to C or USB-C to C Cable
- A microSD Card
- A USB to UART Debugger (e.g., CH340, CH341, FT2232, etc.)
- Three Dupont Cables
- Optional: Monitor/Capture Card & HDMI Cable (for testing the Jammy version with Xfce desktop)

## Installation Steps

### Decompress and Flash Image to microSD Card

Assume `/dev/sdc` is the storage card.

```bash
wipefs -af /dev/sdc
# Jammy Xfce
xzcat Armbian_community_24.5.0-trunk.278_Visionfive2_jammy_edge_5.15.0_xfce_desktop.img.xz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdc iflag=fullblock status=progress bs=4M
# Edge minimal
xzcat Armbian_community_24.5.0-trunk.278_Visionfive2_noble_edge_5.15.0_minimal.img.xz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdc iflag=fullblock status=progress bs=4M
```

### Boot Mode Selection

StarFive VisionFive 2 provides multiple boot modes, which can be configured via onboard dip switches before powering on; the board itself is also silk-screened for reference.

To boot the Armbian image, select the 1-bit QSPI Nor Flash mode (`RGPIO_0 = 0`, `RGPIO_1 = 0`). Note that this mode may require you to update the firmware in the Flash beforehand. If the boot fails, please refer to the official documentation for firmware upgrades: [Updating SPL and U-Boot](https://doc.rvspace.org/VisionFive2/Quick_Start_Guide/VisionFive2_QSG/spl_u_boot_0.html)

### Logging into the System

Log into the system via the serial port.

Upon startup, the system will prompt the user to configure the username, password, timezone, language, etc.

For the Xfce version, configuration completion is required before entering the desktop.

Configuration can be done through the serial port. If a keyboard and monitor are connected, configuration can also be done via the keyboard.

## Expected Results

The system boots normally and allows login through the graphical interface or serial port.

## Actual Results

Both the Xfce and Minimal versions of the system booted normally, and logins via the graphical interface or serial port were successful.
