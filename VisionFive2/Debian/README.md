# Debian VisionFive 2 Test Report

## Test Environment

### Operating System Information

- System Version: Debian bookworm (starfive-jh7110-202403-SD-minimal-desktop-wayland.img.bz2)
- Download Link: https://debian.starfivetech.com/
- Reference Installation Document: https://gitee.com/openeuler/RISC-V/blob/master/release/openEuler-23.03/Installation_Book/Visionfive2/README.md

### Hardware Information

- StarFive VisionFive 2
- A USB power adapter
- A USB-A to C or C to C cable
- A microSD card
- A USB to UART debugger (e.g., CH340, CH341, FT2232, etc.)
- Three Dupont wires

## Installation Steps

### Decompress and Flash Image to microSD Card

Assuming `/dev/sdc` is the storage card.

```bash
bzip2 -dk starfive-jh7110-202403-SD-minimal-desktop-wayland.img.bz2
sudo dd if=starfive-jh7110-202403-SD-minimal-desktop-wayland.img of=/dev/sdc bs=1M status=progress
```

### Boot Mode Selection

StarFive VisionFive 2 offers multiple boot modes, configurable via onboard DIP switches before powering on. The board itself also has silk-screen labels.

To boot the original Debian image, select the 1-bit QSPI Nor Flash mode (i.e., `RGPIO_0 = 0`, `RGPIO_1 = 0`). Note that this mode may require updating the firmware in the Flash beforehand. If the boot is unsuccessful, please refer to the official documentation for firmware upgrade details: [Updating SPL and U-Boot](https://doc.rvspace.org/VisionFive2/Quick_Start_Guide/VisionFive2_QSG/spl_u_boot_0.html)

If not updating the firmware, choose the microSD card boot mode (i.e., `RGPIO_0 = 1`, `RGPIO_1 = 0`).

> Note: There is a slight chance that the system may fail to boot in this mode. If boot failure occurs, the serial output might resemble the following:
>
>```log
>dwmci_s: Response Timeout.                                                                                            
>dwmci_s: Response Timeout.                                                                                            
>BOOT fail,Error is 0xffffffff
>```
>
> You can try repowering the development board or pressing the button near the USB Type-C power port. This usually resolves the boot issue.

### Logging into the System

Log into the system via the serial port.

Default username: `user`
Default password: `starfive`

## Expected Results

The system should boot up normally and allow login via the serial port.

## Actual Results

The system booted up successfully, and login via the serial port was successful.
