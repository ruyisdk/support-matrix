## Test Environment

### Operating System Information

- System Version: Ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS
- Download Link: https://ubuntu.com/download/risc-v
- Reference Installation Document: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/RISC-V/StarFive%20VisionFive%202

## Installation Steps

### Decompress and Flash Image to microSD Card

```bash
xzcat ubuntu-24.04.1-preinstalled-server-riscv64+visionfive2.img.xz | sudo dd bs=1M conv=fsync of=/dev/<your-device>
```

### Boot Mode Selection

The StarFive VisionFive 2 offers multiple boot modes, configurable via onboard dip switches prior to powering on. Refer to the StarFive [official documentation](https://doc.rvspace.org/VisionFive2/Quick_Start_Guide/VisionFive2_SDK_QSG/boot_mode_settings.html).

The board also has silk-screen labels for guidance.

To boot the Ubuntu image, select the SDIO3.0 mode (i.e., `RGPIO_0 = 1`, `RGPIO_1 = 0`).

### First boot

Insert the SD card and power on the board.Enter the U-Boot console by pressing enter when seeing the "Hit any key to stop autoboot:" message to reset the environment:

```
env default -f -a
env save
```

Power cycle the board. When booting the first time wait until you see an output line confirming that cloud-init has finished. Cloud init is responsible for generating the SSH keys and setting the default password. The line to wait for will look similar to
``` log
