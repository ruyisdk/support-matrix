### Hardware Information

- StarFive VisionFive 2
- A USB power adapter
- A USB-A to C or C to C cable
- A microSD card
- A USB to UART debugger (e.g., CH340, CH341, FT2232, etc.)

## Installation Steps

### Decompress and Flash the Image to the microSD Card

Assuming `/dev/sdc` is the storage card.

```bash
bzcat gentoo.img.bz2 | sudo dd of=/dev/sdc iflag=fullblock bs=4M status=progress
```

### Boot Mode Selection

StarFive VisionFive 2 offers various boot modes, configurable via onboard dip switches before powering on. The specific modes are labeled on the development board.

To boot the Gentoo image, select the 1-bit QSPI Nor Flash mode (i.e., `RGPIO_0 = 0`, `RGPIO_1 = 0`). Note that this mode may require prior firmware updates in the Flash. If the boot is unsuccessful, refer to the official documentation for firmware updates: [Update SPL and U-Boot](https://doc.rvspace.org/VisionFive2/Quick_Start_Guide/VisionFive2_QSG/spl_u_boot_0.html)

### Logging into the System

Logging into the system via the serial port.

Username: `root`
No password.

## Expected Results

The system should boot normally and allow login via the serial port.

## Actual Results

The system booted successfully and login via the serial port was successful.
