# openSUSE Tumbleweed VisionFive 2 Test Report

## Test Environment

### Operating System Information

- System Version: openSUSE-Tumbleweed-RISC-V-JeOS-starfivevisionfive2.riscv64-2024.03.15-Build23.14.raw.xz
- Download Link: https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:/RISCV:/Factory:/Contrib:/StarFive:/VisionFive2/images/
- Reference Installation Document: https://en.opensuse.org/HCL:VisionFive2

### Hardware Information

- StarFive VisionFive 2
- A USB Power Adapter
- A USB-A to C or C to C Cable
- A microSD Card
- A USB to UART Debugger (e.g., CH340, CH341, FT2232, etc.)
- Three Dupont Wires

## Installation Steps

### Decompress and Flash the Image to the microSD Card

Assuming `/dev/sdc` is the storage card.

```bash
xzcat openSUSE-Tumbleweed-RISC-V-JeOS-starfivevisionfive2.riscv64-2024.03.15-Build23.14.raw.xz | sudo dd of=/dev/sdc iflag=fullblock status=progress bs=4M
```

### Boot Mode Selection

StarFive VisionFive 2 provides multiple boot modes, configurable through onboard dip switches before powering on; these are marked on the board itself.

To boot the openSUSE image, select the microSD card boot mode (i.e., `RGPIO_0 = 1`, `RGPIO_1 = 0`).

> Note: In this mode, there is a small chance of boot failure. If you encounter boot failure, you might see output similar to the following on the serial port:
>
>```log
>dwmci_s: Response Timeout.                                                                                            
>dwmci_s: Response Timeout.                                                                                            
>BOOT fail,Error is 0xffffffff
>```
>
> You can try repowering the board or pressing the button near the USB Type-C power interface. This usually resolves the issue.

### Logging into the System

Login to the system via the serial port.

Username: `root`
Default Password: `linux`

## Expected Results

The system should boot normally and allow login via the serial port.

## Actual Results

The system booted successfully and login via the serial port was successful.
