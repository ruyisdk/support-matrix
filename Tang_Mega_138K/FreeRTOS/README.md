### Hardware Information

- Tang Mega 138K Pro Dock
- A Type A to C cable
- A UART serial cable
- Power supply come with the board

## Installation Steps

**The following steps are for building in a Linux environment. For Windows, please install AE350 SOC RDS and use the included Cygwin environment. Unless stated otherwise, the operations are the same.**

*If IDE functionality is not required, RDS License is not necessary for building in Windows.*

### Copy and Patch Code

FreeRTOS code can be found in the source code archive at ref_design/MCU_RefDesign/ae350_freertos. Extract it to your working directory.

For Linux: patch the Debug/makefile:
Replace the following content:
```diff
diff --git a/Debug/makefile b/Debug/makefile
index eb97e6d..232a162 100644
--- a/Debug/makefile
+++ b/Debug/makefile
@@ -117,7 +117,7 @@ $(SECONDARY_OUTPUT_PATH)/.PHONY.size: $(LINKER_OUTPUTS)
 
 $(SECONDARY_OUTPUT_PATH)/ae350-ddr.ld: $(SAG_SRCS)
 	@echo 'Invoking: LdSaG Tool'
-	nds_ldsag --version=v5 -t "$(ANDESIGHT_ROOT)/utils/nds32_template_v5.txt" "$(SAG_FILE)" -o $(LDSAG_OUT)
+	cp ../src/bsp/sag/ae350-ddr.ld $(LDSAG_OUT)
 	@echo 'Finished building: $@'
 	@echo ' '
 

```
If it fails, ensure the line endings are CRLF.

Replace the working path:
```bash
find -name "*.mk" -exec sed -i "s|/cygdrive/E/RDS5/workspace/ae350_freertos|$(pwd)|g" {} \;
```

### Compile Code

#### Linux
Unpack the cross-compilation toolchain, preferably nds32le-elf-mculib-v5. Refer to its location as `$(nds32_path)`.

Compile the target file:
```bash
cd Debug
make CROSS_COMPILE=$(nds32_path)/bin/riscv32-elf-
```

#### Windows
Open the Cygwin environment included with RDS:
Run Cygwin.bat in the RDS installation directory.

Navigate to the source code folder (disks are located under `/cygdrive/$(drive_letter)`)

Compile the target file, with RDS_ROOT being replaced by your RDS installation path:
```bash
cd Debug
make ANDESIGHT_ROOT=<RDS_ROOT> CROSS_COMPILE=<RDS_ROOT>/toolchains/nds32le-elf-mculib-v5/bin/riscv32-elf-
```

### Get FPGA Bitstream

**Tang Mega 138K support is available only in the commercial version**

The FPGA project can use the demo provided by Sipeed, found in the ae350_customized_demo from the [TangMega-138KPro-example](https://github.com/sipeed/TangMega-138KPro-example). The bitstream is pre-compiled and does not need to be regenerated.

### Download Bitstream

Connect the FPGA and use the Gowin's cloud software to download the bitstream.

### Flash the Program

Use programmer.exe located in the flash directory of the RDS. Set up as follows:
- External Flash Mode 5AT
- exFlash C Bin Erase, Program 5AT
- Start address: 0x600000

If there's no output after flashing, try re-downloading the bitstream.

### Connect Serial Port

The default UART2 is bound to:
```
IO_LOC "UART2_TXD" U16;     //1
IO_LOC "UART2_RXD" V16;     //2
```

### View Output

Check the FreeRTOS output through the serial port.

## Expected Results

The system should boot normally and allow you to view FreeRTOS output via the onboard serial port.

## Actual Results

The system booted successfully and the FreeRTOS output was visible through the onboard serial port.
